# Advent of Code goes Elixir
After some inspiration from [lunjon](https://github.com/lunjon) here comes my attempt to learn some Elixir by solving assignments from [Advent of Code 2015](https://adventofcode.com/2015).

## Running
From the respective directory, run `elixir day1.exs`.

## Testing
Didn't get that far with my Elixir experience...
